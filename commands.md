# Commands

All commands are accessible using `/adaptiveview`.

## Notifications

`/adaptiveview notifications` allows you to `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` to notifications when the view distance `changes` or a `lock` is set or removed.

## Lock

`/adaptiveview lock` allows you to check if the View or Simulation Distance is currently locked and allows to lock it.

- `main [chunks] {[condition]}` locks the View Distance and Simulation Distance to `chunks`.
- `view [chunks] {[condition]}` locks the View Distance to `chunks`.
- `simulation [chunks] {[condition]}` locks the Simulation Distance to `chunks`.

#### Conditions
`conditon` is a optional condition that allows you to specify when the View Distance lock is cleared. There are the following conditions:

  - `player [name] disconnect` the specified player leaves the game
  - `player [name] move` the specified player moves
  - `timeout [ticks]` the specified time in ticks has passed

## Unlock

`/adaptiveview unlock` allows you to unlock the View and Simulation Distance.

- `all` clears all locks, that don't have a condition for automatic unlocking
- `view` clears all View Distance locks, that don't have a condition for automatic unlocking
- `simulation` clears all Simulation Distance locks, that don't have a condition for automatic unlocking

- `[unlock] clear` also clears the locks, that have a condition for automatic unlocking

## Config

`/adaptiveview config` allows you to view and set all config options

### General usage

- `[option-name]` allows you to view the option
- `[option-name] [value]` sets the value of the option
- `[option-name] clear` clears the value of the option (only available for some options)

### Rules
- `rules` shows you an index list of all options
- `rules [index]` selects a specific rule to view and edit
- `rules add [type] [condition-options]` adds a rule of the specific type with specified condition options (the action needs to be edited afterwards)

## All commands:

Commands followed by a `+` require one of the following options to work.
